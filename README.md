# Scheduling-Algorithm
This Java program provides an interface to the user to implement the following 
scheduling policies as per the choice provided: 
1. First Come First Served (FCFS) 
2. Round Robin (RR) 
Appropriate option needs to be chosen from a switch case based menu driven program with an option of 
“Exit from program” in case 5 and accordingly a scheduling policy will print the Gantt chart and the average 
waiting time, average turnaround time and average response time. The program will take Process ids, its 
arrival time, and its CPU burst time as input. For implementing RR scheduling, user also needs to specify 
the time quantum. Assume that the process ids should be unique for all processes. Each process consists of a 
single CPU burst (no I/O bursts), and processes are listed in order of their arrival time. Further assume that 
an interrupted process gets placed at the back of the Ready queue, and a newly arrived process gets placed at 
the back of the Ready queue as well. The output should be displayed in a formatted way for clarity of 
understanding and visual.
